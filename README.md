# Soul Token Smart Contract

## Overview

The Soul Token smart contract is an ERC-1155 token contract designed to represent a game scenario where each wallet can own a unique, soulbound main token. Additionally, users can mint and transact item tokens that are associated with the soulbound main token. This contract is suitable for scenarios such as a game where the main token represents a character and item tokens represent accessories or items related to the character.

## Functionality

### 1. Mint Soulbound Main Token

- **Function:** `mintSoulboundToken`
- **Description:** Allows the owner to mint a soulbound main token and assign it to a specific address.
- **Usage:** This function is typically called by the contract owner to distribute soulbound main tokens to different wallets.

### 2. Mint Item Token

- **Function:** `mintItemToken`
- **Description:** Allows the owner of the soulbound main token to mint item tokens associated with their main token.
- **Usage:** Users can call this function to create item tokens that are linked to their soulbound main token.

### 3. Transfer Item Token

- **Function:** `transferItemToken`
- **Description:** Enables the owner of the soulbound main token to transfer item tokens to other addresses that also own the soulbound main token.
- **Usage:** Users can transfer item tokens to other wallets possessing the soulbound main token.

### 4. Burn Soulbound Main Token

- **Function:** `burnSoulboundToken`
- **Description:** Allows the owner of the soulbound main token to burn (destroy) a specific amount of their own main tokens.
- **Usage:** Users can use this function to reduce the quantity of their soulbound main tokens.

### 5. Restrictions on Main Token Transfer

- **Function:** `_beforeTokenTransfer`
- **Description:** Ensures that the soulbound main token cannot be transferred to another wallet, only burned by the owner.
- **Usage:** This internal hook is automatically called before any token transfer.

## Deployment

1. **Deploy on a Testnet (e.g., Sepolia):**
